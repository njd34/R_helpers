# rhelpers

A basic R package containing helper functions that I use regularly across projects.

Built using instructions [here](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

Install using `devtools` as follows:

```
library(devtools)
setwd('rhelpers_parent_directory')
install('rhelpers')
```
